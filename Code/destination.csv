3,@ @ @ distress call. I thought it was hi-jacked and being flown by then. If it's true that the co-pilot did
3,@ @ @ No, somebody had just initiated the descent, and might have been unconcious or dead just after that.
3,@ @ @ Unless they became rapidly unconcious
3,@ @ @ Sent Mayday through radio. I suppose he had other things to do than adjust the Squawk
3,@ @ @ Autopilot was manually changed from 38,000 to 100 ft at 09:30:55 (Flightradar24 says)
2,@ @ @ What's the use when you're crashing?
3,@ @ @ For sure not, it was following exactly the same flight path as day before http-link
3,@ Sounds like a decent of 2900fpm
3,@ the flight profile. That doesn't indicate that the autopilot was set to 100 feet. I've worked on these systems, tested them
3,@ But that's the FMC, doesn't mean autopilot was engaged.
3,@ Have you operated a flight mqnagement computer before? I used to test them. What FlightRadar24 is ahowing is changes made
3,@ @ @ Only takes a second to set the squawk code,
3,@ what's the use of changing FMC if autopilot not engaged?
0,@ The autopilot wasn't set to 100 feet. It was flown manually. FlightRadar24 has made that up.
3,@ @ @ What I'm saying is, I believe it was deliberately crashed. Being controlled all the way into the ground
3,@ @ @ which seems to be the case.Constant descent, wind variations set aside..
3,@ @ @ @ yes but every second not spent trying to save everyone.....
1,@ @ @ The transponder did not say anything. No sqwak 7700.
3,@ @ yes and no depends on other traffic, turbulence... they were 25 mins late so going higher = going quicker
3,@ @ @ @ Yep, it's follow exactly the route going down, that seems to suggest unconscious pilots.

0,@ yessss!!
3,@ @ yes from her newly decorated LA living room. Just like Egypt.
1,@ @ @ @ they confirm facts before 'reporting'.
3,@ maybe people shouldn't look to the tweets of comedy writers for their news facts?
0,@ agreed
0,@ @ @ the news report I'm watching currently reported the same thing before Kelly tweeted it.
1,@ @ maybe you should have a news crew on retainer just in case. Rapid deploy anywhere breaking news happens.
1,@ might want to actually confirm shit like that before tweeting.
3,@ @ @ CBC news is reporting the gunman has been shot. Are you bitching at them also?
0,@ @ I had heard the same before I saw you &amp; many others tweet.
3,@ Was it your Canada when that guy beheaded that other guy on the bus? Shit happens, but we're mostly still fine up here
3,@ @ I can get confirmation and video from witnesses and pass info along without a news producer. Simple stuff.
3,@ @ great response bro.
1,@ what's your source? That's not confirmed!
0,@ my thoughts also
1,@ @ @ Stated as fact before news outlets even suggested.Still uncertain.Leave news to news pros.Done here.
3,@ @ @ hey kid, go enjoy this weird sense of power I've afforded you this morning. Spend it wisely!!
1,@ @ @ Not a comment. Stated gunman had been neutralized.Simply not true. Over 500k followers.Irresponsible.
0,@ @ @ Perhaps all of Twitter should follow HDM so we can learn the proper ways of Tweeting responsibly.
3,@ @ you managed to confirm before any other news outlet in Canada. Bravo.
2,@ @ @ Kudos to your relaying of second-hand information! Do you have an app?
3,@ It's Harper's Canada though
0,@ @ @ seeing as though I was 100% correct, yes.
1,@ @ there has been zero confirmation that gunman is down. Maybe let news outlets on scene handle the reporting.
0,@ @ @ why shouldn't a private citizen make a comment on a news event?
0,@ @ @ Thanks, that was considerate of you! All the best.
3,@ @ I try‚Ä¶. Unfortunately I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôd protect me against bullets
0,@ I know what I'm doing here, thanks.
3,@ @ where's the "(sigh) I give up" emoticon? Do you not understand twitter?
1,@ please wait on this. Also sounds like multiple suspects. People need to stay vigilant.
3,@ @ I had confirmed the first gunman was dead when I tweeted.
0,@ @ exactly, because they are "journalists" and "dems the rules" Kelly is a "comedic writer" no rules. Go police journalists
3,@ the gunman is still on the loose.
0,@ @ THANK YOU.
3,@ Oh Canada‚Ä¶.
3,@ @ @ No, you're right. We should follow comedic writers and trust their sources. That's my first instinct.
3,@ I would like to be paid for it, on account of being a journalist.
3,@ @ wow. Prayers for the soldier.
3,@ You don't have any evidence that he didn't do any of these things in addition to taking a picture, but you accuse away.
3,@ stay safe. Hope you're never in the same situation.

3,@ @ I agree Tyler, have some respect.That man shot is servicing your country and all you want to do is snap a pic.Pity you!
3,@ @ I didn't realize you were on the scene and could verify that he could have saved the life of the guy shot four times.
2,@ Hi Peter, this is Marta, reporter from Demotix. Did you take the photo? Would be ok for us to use? Can you send it? thanks
3,@ thank you for posting. It may just be hard to tell in the picture but bystanders look quite calm considering gunfire in area.
3,@ yeah posting information about an evolving shooter situation is less worthwhile than an untrained journalist performing CPR
3,@ Yeah, sure. Please credit me though.
3,@ my main issue was the picture. Heard your reporting on cnn thought you did a good job. Continue to be safe.
3,@ don't have to give cpr. Other ways to help. But yeah keep looking for profit. Great professionalism.
2,@ could you email me please to subeditors@demotix.com and I'll explain better, thx
1,@ I have no issue with warning people whatsoever. But to take a photo, please!
3,@ so.. Instead of helping you took a picture for profit?
2,@ @ Getting the word out about an active shooter situation seems pretty helpful, but please, tell us what you'd have done.
3,@ @ so yeah, expecting to get paid for doing his job seems pretty professional to me
2,@ I'm a Photo Editor @ ABC- Would you be willing to share this with all ABC News platforms and with partners if we credit?
3,@ @ Who the hell would shoot a protector of our freedoms, not a Canadian I hope !
3,@ @ ...seriously?! You're trying to profit from this? Think about it...

3,@ A robbery doesn't excuse an execution style murder I don't give a fuck what anyone says. Swisher Sweets aren't worth a life.

3,@ he stole a candy bar and was threatened the cops will come to resolve the issue
3,@ # if those kids were involved why would the officer just tell the kids to get on the sidewalk, not get on the ground?
3,@ It smells don't it. This is the plan to get Darren Wilson off. Period.
3,@ He did that quickly &amp; made moves. Like ok lets get that wheel spinning.
3,@ @ They're trying to skirt the situation &amp; take focus off of Darren Wilson. Who's left over to blame? Dead victim.
3,@ Smearing the victim, tainting any jury pool, dodging out of the real questions. This is definitely a calculated smoke screen
3,@ that was their intent all along. Brown will be painted a "thug" and "deserves" what he got.

1,@ terrible attempt at humor. Shame on you.

1,Funny. Unfortunately wrestling a cops gun away would have gotten you shot 50 yrs ago &amp; it will get you shot 50 yrs from now. @
3,@ @ you know that was funny!
3,@ ... That's just plain funny.
3,@ That's only in countries that need to be converted!
3,@ I'm curious, had the suspect been white would the PD have acted the same?
0,@ it sure did. A boon to my #
3,@ @ @ @ If he was shot in the back he was running away but shot in the chest he could have been charging.
3,@ @ @ @ why don't you check out the racial profiling statistics of the Ferguson PD? some real, hard facts.
3,@ @ They can't release shooting info cause they are still interviewing witnesses. Media wanted this info.
3,@ @ @ @ country is just not paying close enough attention."
3,@ @ @ @ Simple: Mike Brown was Inspector Gadget.
2,@ @ @ @ What they did today was also a good way to taint the jury pool.
3,@ p sure you know the answer to that question.
3,@ And that's the point. That's what people are upset about, I think.
3,@ @ @ @ everyone agrees he was shot once at close range and multiple times at 30+ feet.
1,@ @ @ @ What other info do they have ready to release? All they have said is this is why we approached him.
3,@ strongly agree. I know policing is a terribly high-stress job, but most people are not criminals.
3,@ @ @ What case? It's totally cool to shoot unarmed people suspected of a crime!
1,@ @ @ @ I do, but do you have a basic understanding of the judicial system? Let's hear both sides then decide.
3,@ @ @ @ P MUCH
3,@ An open mind waits for all the facts then decides. An empty one makes a decision before the investigation is over.
2,@ @ @ @ Why wasn't Dorian Johnson arrested if he was suspected of a robbery?
0,@ Perhaps they need to alter/improve their training.
3,@ I believe I read something like Ferguson is 29% white but the PD is 94% white.
3,@ @ @ @ They've already said he shot him once from the car. Christ.
2,@ @ @ @ dude, come on. This rogue cop apparently thought he was Judge Dredd and murdered an unarmed kid.
2,@ @ @ @ Was he shot in the chest or back? From 35' away or 3' away? Which wounds came first?
3,@ @ @ @ Right there you just admired they are all bad witnesses if they have distrusts in cops.
0,@ @ How? They are giving info that the media asked for.
3,@ @ per chief belmar: "a shot was fired inside the car, and Brown was eventually shot about 35 feet away from the vehicle."
1,@ @ @ @ You're making an assumption about something based on other peoples actions, that's my point.
3,@ it's also pretty upsetting that a kid was summarily executed for maybe stealing a pack of cigars.
3,@ @ @ @ Rand Paul, yesterday: "Anyone who thinks race does not skew the application of criminal justice in this
3,@ @ @ @ and that suppressing or selectively releasing info led to people deciding for themselves.
3,@ White or Black the biggest prob people have with police is the attitude from cops. We are a guilty till proven innocent society.
3,@ @ @ @ There are several witnesses. They don't all know each other and they're all saying the same things.
0,@ @ @ @ Anybody who uses it at every opportunity falsely weakens the message.
3,@ @ @ @ What they also did was chose to not ignore facts that call in to question the witness' credibility.
3,@ @ They are releasing irrelevant info that doesn't affect the case of Michael Brown's shooting
3,@ there's a difference between an open mind and an empty one
1,@ @ @ @ then tell me the people of Ferguson haven't EARNED some distrust.
2,@ @ @ @ to have the Supreme Court declare open season for cops on the population is a deliberate decision.
3,@ @ They can't tie the two together cause they are separate issues. Releasing at different times puts distance between them.
3,@ @ @ @ Rand Paul used those words BECAUSE of this incident. Just fuck off dude. Fuck off so hard.
0,@ @ @ @ You don't want to see what's happening? Fine. Keep being naive. Good day.
1,@ @ @ @ Did you see him stand 30' away and get shot? No. A few people who have a problem with cops did.
2,@ @ Are you saying they start at the end and don't explain why he was approached by cops?
3,@ @ @ @ That's two different arguments.
3,@ @ @ @ Not releasing facts about that shooting is also a way to make sure they get good info from witnesses.
2,@ @ I blocked him, so you can leave me off the tweets. I won't see them, gives you more characters.
3,@ why would the ferguson PD and STLCO PD release the information they've released and fail to mention that?
1,@ @ @ @ Yeah, I would totally expect a kid that's been shot to run away, get shot again, and decide to charge.
3,@ @ also wrong venues and in wrong order. After his summary execution in the street, they are trying him through the media.
3,@ @ @ @ LOL
2,@ @ @ @ Has that info came out yet?
2,@ @ @ @ in your world, it's cool to shoot unarmed people in the chest, but not the back? Or vice versa?
0,@ @ And there was a struggle inside the car. How do we know Brown didn't get the gun and fire the shot during the struggle?
3,@ @ @ @ I don't think i did say that. I did criticize a Supreme Court decision I've read many times.
3,@ @ ok
3,@ this turned out to be a very popular tweet
3,@ @ @ @ They didn't say who fired the shots in the car. The fact is we've only heard one side.
2,@ @ @ @ If he was shot in the chest how was he running away?
3,@ Also per last press conf, local PD depts seem super disconnected and out of touch with African American community.
3,@ @ @ @ who says it's false? There's a large &amp; documented history of this PD arresting too many blacks.
1,@ @ @ @ Ok, so you get accounts from the community he lives in where people already have a distrust in police
1,@ @ @ @ confused how an unarmed person, charging, retreating, or standing still, is a threat to a cop 30' away
1,@ @ @ @ UNSUBSCRIBE
3,@ @ @ @ the investigation (e.g., that officer had a facial injury).
2,@ @ @ @ an investigative report on the shooting?
3,@ @ @ @ I see a lot of people making assumptions with limited facts. We haven't even seen an autopsy report.
3,@ @ @ @ that's an account FROM THE STL CO POLICE CHIEF
0,@ Agree. Not worth the bullets whatsoever.
3,@ @ @ @ that I don't like racial profiling and think police should obey the law? That is definitely my agenda.
3,@ @ @ @ For you to declare he was executed without any facts is also as absurd.
3,@ @ @ @ and you want to make a decision without any hard facts.
2,@ @ @ @ What? No it isn't. There is definitely no justification for deadly force once he was running.
0,@ @ @ @ they've systematically only released information that makes them look good, even info that might taint
0,@ @ @ @ So no matter that evidence comes out during the investigation that's what you're going with?
3,@ At least they are thorough. @
3,@ @ @ @ No that you see this as a racial situation before you know anything.
3,@ @ @ @ If he was shot in the chest or back is the biggest factor in who is right.
3,@ @ @ @ I'm relying on details agreed upon by the police and the witnesses.
0,@ @ @ @ autopsy report SPOILER alert: died from multiple gunshot wounds
3,@ @ @ @ do you not even have a basic understanding why people mistrust police?
3,@ @ @ @ it is! I both argued that the Supreme Court was wrong . . .
3,@ @ @ @ He admitted they stole cigars to DOJ &amp; StL County PD. He wasn't charged b/c he didn't commit a crime.
3,@ @ @ @ and that is part of what's distressing. Police screw up and make bad decisions in any system.
0,@ @ @ @ I don't understand the double standard of wanting all the info about the cop but Brown's past is safe.
2,@ @ @ @ That right there tells me you are going into this with an agenda.
3,@ @ @ @ and not releasing any facts is a real good way to make sure people pass judgment on the facts they have
2,@ How many weeks until police interview witnesses? @

3,.@jashsf @ I've been in # Market and it looks exactly like where the alleged robber was standing.
2,@ @ thanks. Now we need a pic of what michael brown was wearing to refute the video.
3,@ a person who makes his living asking questions, that's who.
3,@ Who are you to expect any type of answer in the first place?
2,@ @ it wasn't the quik stop that got burned down?
3,@ @ @ @ dude give it up. It's him. Confirmed.
2,@ @ @ even though his friend and witness to the shooting has admitted to the cigarillo theft?
3,Y'all --&gt; "@andybankertv Store owner told @ Monday that there was a theft, but said it was not MichaelBrown said it was someone else"
3,@ @ @ dude even his parents acknowledge it's him.
3,@ @ @ I def did not say that. And even if it was # I certainly don't think he deserved to die for it.
2,@ @ @ @ I'm not arguing that he deserved to be shot.
3,@ @ This is getting stranger by the minute. Will we ever get to the truth?
3,@ "@andybankertv Store owner told @ Monday that there was a theft, but said it was not MichaelBrown; said it was someone else"
3,@ @ @ we all need to unite then. solidarity is key in the face of adversity and prejudice.
3,@ @ @ Hey everybody, @ robbed a store. Can they shoot you down? Can I say that after they shoot you down?
0,@ I could tell it wasn't him when I saw the video. @ @
3,@ @ @ you just repeated what you said in the last tweet, p sure my reply doesn't change
2,@ @ Any chance that's being said for fear of retribution?
2,@ @ why did the store owner say it wasn't him and the friend admitted it was? Have the gotten an explanation
2,@ @ @ @ whose mike smith ?
3,@ @ @ im not saying you did, but that is what has been implied the entire course of this investigation
1,@ @ @ Not by this kid.
3,@ @ @ or is that impossible because the police would never be capable of unscrupulous behavior?
3,@ @ @ Then what are you arguing?
3,@ @ @ looooool. "snitches get stiches in the hood" (noracist bro)
3,@ @ think he was too scare to tell who it really was? How many 6'5" 300 # men in Ferguson ?
3,@ @ no doubt scared for his life. It's obviously mike brown in the video
3,@ @ when I spoke to store owner, I said "robbery", tweeted "theft" in error
0,@ @ @ you seem to be the only one and that is a testament to your character miss.
3,@ @ possibly. He seemed frightened
3,@ now we now why!! Jeez!!
2,@ @ Is that the video also?
3,@ @ @ Good job getting (a guy who looks a bit like a) petty thief off the street (four hours after shooting him)
2,@ @ @ And the store owner and the pictures say it wasn't. Why does someone who didn't see it matter?
3,@ @ Brown's family attorney said in an interview today that the person in the video "probably is Brown"
3,@ @ @ snitches get stitches in the hood. Store owner knows. # #
3,@ @ @ Dorian Johnson just confirmed it was them. What now? #
3,@ @ @ There are lots of us out there. Promise.
3,@ @ @ @ And also obliterating your attempt to deny that he was the person that robbed the store
3,@ @ @ You get the last word here, I can't argue with everyone forever. Peace.
3,@ @ Your post states theft. What am I missing?
3,@ @ @ it's obviously the same people and there's a confession
3,@ @ @ that's why the police's testimony has been considered law despite it contrasting what EYEWITNESSES said
2,@ @ Thank you for clarifying. You definitely didn't have to reply to me. Have a great day and thanks for the reports
3,@ @ @ @ Very embarrassing! Of course I meant # Ugh
2,@ @ Where's @ @ With this breaking news? Police Chief making press conference. # #
0,@ @ @ Truer words have never been spoken.
3,@ @ Somebody else probably did commit theft. Brown committed Robbery.
2,@ @ @ So he took off his socks but did nothing else to change his appearance? Obliterated, lol
3,@ @ @ and the last time i checked the eyewitness testimony overrides the testimony of the defident's friends
3,@ @ @ but reasonable doubt? Innocent until proven guilt? Nah, fuck it, let's execute him
3,@ @ he seemed frightened
3,@ @ @ Obviously? So he took off his socks in the 5m between the video and getting shot? http-link
2,@ @ @ or maybe the police scared him into saying it was michael brown in the first place?
3,@ @ actually I did use the word robbery
3,@ But Dorian Johnson already admitted they were in store and stole
3,@ @ @ but you have two pictures of people with different clothes, and an eyewitness who says it wasn't him

1,@ You are supposed to not be biased when you're a journalist. Glad you can come up with that decision without knowing all the facts

3,@ @ a story that continues to repeat itself, over and over and over in America. #
1,@ no he was walking IN the street big difference

0,@ @ look at the shoes
2,@ @ Where is the video from the cellphone taken from one of the witnesses who saw Brown shot and killed?
3,@ It's easier to manipulate pictures than a video.
3,@ maybe they will do like 911 and cut out frames
1,@ is that even him in the stills?
